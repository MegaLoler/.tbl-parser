; this is a test table file!!

; start a table
; the name is 'test table'
; its version 1
; and it consists of rows with items called a, b, and c
# "test table" 1 "a b c" ; online comment

; here are a few rows in that table
1 2 3
the second row
"this is" "also" 'a row (the third one in fact)'
'you can "nest these"' yep yo

## this is "also a valid row???"
; alth now u cant have empty rows bc itll think its implied third heading lol
## so-u-must-continue-with-this-untul-next-low-heading _ _
## ^ "that means" ditto

; heres version two of that table (completely different actually LOL)
# "test table" 2 "a b: c"
; this time we consist of blocks with items a and b in their headers, 
; each of which contains rows with a single item calld c

## here "is a block"
and-this-is-c
another-c

# "test table" 3 "A B: C" ; case retaining
; this time we will use the "no # level" (which is interpreted as the final level)
; meaning its impossible to nest deeper, so that there will be NO ITEMS in such blocks!!
this is-a-block
but-as-you-can-see 'its impossible to nest deeper bc we are already as deep as possible this way!'

## so "instead we have to do this"
'so now we have a c'
'and another!'
